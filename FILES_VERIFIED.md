## 🔗 Test URLs

### Port 3000 or 3002?
The server might be running on either port. Try both:

**Port 3000:**
- http://localhost:3000/admin/login
- http://localhost:3000/consultation

**Port 3002:**
- http://localhost:3002/admin/login
- http://localhost:3002/consultation

---

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Wait for Server (30 seconds)
The server is starting up. Wait for the console to show "Ready"

### Step 2: Check Which Port
Look at your terminal to see which port it's using:
- "Local: http://localhost:3000" OR
- "Local: http://localhost:3002"

### Step 3: Test Admin Login
1. Open: `http://localhost:[PORT]/admin/login`
2. Password: `admin123`
3. Should redirect to dashboard ✅

### Step 4: Test Booking
1. Open: `http://localhost:[PORT]/consultation`
2. Fill out the form
3. Submit
4. Check admin dashboard for the booking ✅

## 🐛 If Still Getting 404

Try these in order:

### 1. Check Server is Running
Look at terminal - should see "✓ Ready"

### 2. Check Port Number
Terminal shows which port (3000 or 3002)

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
- Chrome/Edge: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Safari: Cmd+Option+E then Cmd+R

### 4. Try Incognito/Private Window
Opens clean without cache

### 5. Check Files Exist
Run in terminal:
```bash
ls -la src/app/admin/login/page.tsx
ls -la src/app/api/admin/auth/route.ts
```

Should show files with sizes (not 0 bytes)

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Admin Login Page Should Show:
- 🔒 Lock icon
- "Admin Access" heading
- Password input field
- "Login" button
- "Default password: admin123" hint

### After Login:
- Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
- See statistics cards
- See filter tabs
- See bookings list (or "No bookings" if empty)

---

## ✨ Everything is Ready!

All files are:
- ✅ Created
- ✅ Verified to exist
- ✅ Server restarted with clean cache
- ✅ Ready to test

**Just wait for server to finish starting (~30 seconds) and test the URL!**

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

1. Wait for server console to show "Ready"
2. Open: http://localhost:3000/admin/login (or 3002 if that's what's shown)
3. Type: `admin123`
4. Click "Login"
5. **You should see the dashboard!** 🎉

If you see the login page (not 404), it's working! ✅
