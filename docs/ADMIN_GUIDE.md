## Security

### Changing Admin Password
To change the admin password:

1. Open: `src/app/api/admin/auth/route.ts`
2. Modify line 15 to change the password:
   ```typescript
   const isValid = password === "your_new_password";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart the server

For production use, we recommend:
- Using environment variables for the password
- Implementing proper JWT-based authentication
- Adding rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
